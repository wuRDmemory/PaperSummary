  our map does not merely maintain labeled independent 3D points by projecting semantic information from images into the 3D structure. Rather, the objects are separate entities completely independent from the non-object parts of the map. This enables more advanced scene understanding, e.g. **a robot can reason that all 3D points belonging to one object in the map will move together upon manipulation.**
